Revision history for Perl extension Coro.

0.03  Fri Jul 13 14:51:52 CEST 2001
	- slight internal architecture change: Coro:: is now
          really low-level and can thus be used to implement other
          interesting things (but better use Coro::Process for
          interoperability ;).
        - $_ and $@ are no longer being localized.

0.02  Tue Jul 10 01:38:17 CEST 2001
	- implemented "async" attribute.
        - $_ and $@ are now localized.
        - added Coro::Channel.
        - more testcases, still no docs.

0.01  Tue Jul  3 02:18:41 CEST 2001
