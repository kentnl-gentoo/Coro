This is a mess. There is not much structure to this code, and it is not
ready for release ;)

1. read MANIFEST
2. copy config.pl.dist to config.pl
3. mkdir db && mkdir logs
4. make sure port 7262 (shell!) is firewalled
5. perl myhttpd

if you find any bugs => complain. if you don't understand the code,
meditate, then complain. if you want to restructure it, go on, i'll do
this myself once i have time, and the cdurrent file structure likely won't
survive.
