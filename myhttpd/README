This is a mess. There is not much structure to this code, and it is not
ready for release ;)

1. read MANIFEST
2. copy config.pl.dist to config.pl
3. mkdir db && mkdir logs
4. make sure port 7262 (shell!) is firewalled
5. perl myhttpd

if you find any bugs => complain. if you don't understand the code,
meditate, then complain. if you want to restructure it, go on, i'll do
this myself once i have time, and the cdurrent file structure likely won't
survive.

Yeah, and security problems. With no firewall, "telnet anime.plan9.de 
7262" would give you a very simple server shell where you can change
things (and execute any command you like), so watch out for this ;)

I often use:

 current rate
   cmd> p $tbf_top->{rate}
   RES = 118000

 set new tbf rate
   cmd> p $tbf_top->{rate} = 118000
   RES = 118000

 set the current estimated queue to 5hrs/100MB
   cmd> p $queue_file->{avgspb} = 0.0002
   RES = 0.0002
